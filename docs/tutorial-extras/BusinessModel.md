# Business Model

## Introduction

EduFunding is a decentralized platform that addresses the funding gap in education by leveraging blockchain technology, decentralized finance (DeFi), and community governance. The platform connects donors, students, schools, and investors, creating a transparent and sustainable funding ecosystem that benefits all participants.

---

## Revenue Streams

EduFunding's business model revolves around several key revenue streams:

### 1. **Transaction Fees**

- **Donor Fees:** A small percentage fee will be charged for every donation made to the platform. This fee will cover operational costs such as AI verification, blockchain transaction fees, and smart contract execution.
- **Loan Repayment Fees:** A small fee will be charged on loan repayments made through the platform. This will help cover the ongoing monitoring of loan status, NFT updates, and ZK proof verification.

### 2. **Platform Membership Fees (for Schools and Donors)**

- **Institutional Membership Fees:** Schools and educational institutions can pay a nominal membership fee to join the platform and gain access to funding and other resources available to them through EduFunding.
- **Donor Membership Fees:** Donors, particularly large philanthropic organizations, can pay a subscription fee to access exclusive funding opportunities, reports, and insights into the progress of their funded projects.

### 3. **EduToken Utility**

- **EduToken Staking:** As donors accumulate EduTokens, they can stake them to gain governance rights in the platform's DAO. Staking EduTokens could provide additional rewards or incentives.
- **Token Burn Mechanism:** A small percentage of EduTokens collected through platform transactions could be periodically burned to help increase the scarcity and value of remaining tokens.
- **Marketplace and NFT Sales:** EduFunding can introduce a marketplace for the NFTs that represent loan agreements or funding certificates, creating an additional avenue for generating revenue through secondary sales.

### 4. **Partnerships and Sponsorships**

- **Partnerships with Universities and Institutions:** EduFunding can collaborate with universities, educational foundations, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that want to sponsor students or schools in need. These partnerships can help generate funds, increase the platform's reach, and offer additional financial support to the ecosystem.
- **Corporate Sponsorships:** Large companies or socially responsible businesses can partner with EduFunding to sponsor educational initiatives or provide matching donations for students and schools.
