---

## For Students and Schools

### 5. How can I apply for funding?

1. Select your role (Student or School) on the platform.
2. Fill out the application form with required personal or institutional details.
3. Upload supporting documents (e.g., ID, academic transcripts).
4. Submit your application for AI verification.

---

### 6. What happens if my application fails AI verification?

- Your application will be rejected.
- No on-chain record will be created.
- You can review and correct your documents and try reapplying.

---

### 7. How is my personal information protected?

- Personal data is hashed using SHA-256 before being stored on-chain.
- Supporting documents are stored securely off-chain using IPFS with encryption.
- Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) are used to verify repayments without exposing sensitive income information.

---

## For Donors

### 8. How can I donate to students or schools?

1. Connect your crypto wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect) to the platform.
2. Browse the list of verified and DAO-approved applicants.
3. Select a student or school you wish to fund.
4. Donate ETH or stablecoins via the platform.

---

### 9. What do I receive in return for donating?

- You will be rewarded with **EduTokens**, an ERC20 token representing your contribution.
- EduTokens track your reputation and qualify you for DAO membership and governance privileges.

---

### 10. Are my donations tax-deductible?

Currently, EduFunding does not automatically handle tax deductions. You should consult with your tax advisor regarding the eligibility of crypto donations for tax benefits in your country.

---

## For DAO Members

### 11. How do I become a DAO member?

---

### 13. How is voting done on EduFunding?

- Approves or rejects applications based on the verification outcome.

---

### 15. How does the loan repayment NFT system work?

- Students receiving loans are issued NFTs that record loan amount, repayment terms, and status.
- Students submit **ZK Proofs** monthly to verify their income without revealing sensitive data.
- Once fully repaid, the NFT is updated to "Cleared" status, improving the student's reputation on the platform.

---

### 16. How is my donation protected?

- Donations are managed by the **DonationVault** smart contract.
