# Market Opportunity

## Introduction

The need for accessible, transparent, and decentralized educational funding solutions is more pressing than ever. Traditional scholarship and loan systems are often marred by bureaucracy, limited reach, corruption, and inefficiencies. EduFunding introduces a decentralized alternative, opening an untapped market segment within both the education sector and the decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape.

## The Global Education Crisis

- **Over 260 million** children and youth were out of school in 2023 (UNESCO).
- **Financial constraints** are cited as a major reason for school dropouts in developing regions.
- **Student loan debts** have skyrocketed, with the U.S. alone accounting for **over $1.7 trillion**.
- **School infrastructure** in underserved communities remains poor due to lack of funding.

The traditional system leaves brilliant but disadvantaged students behind, stifling social mobility and economic growth.
